# Sequence Game Generator

## Overview

This project is a Sequence Game Generator that uses LEDs to create a memory challenge game. Players must remember and replicate the sequence in which the LEDs blink. If the sequence is replicated correctly, the game proceeds to the next round with an additional LED in the sequence.

## Features

- **LED Sequencing**: LEDs blink in a specific sequence that players must memorize and replicate.
- **Incremental Difficulty**: Each round adds an additional LED to the sequence if the player correctly replicates the previous sequence.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides clear visual feedback for correct and incorrect sequences.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/santosh2uu2/sequencegamegenerator.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project in Your IDE**: Open the cloned project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. **Build the Project**: Compile the project using your IDE's build tools.
4. **Run the Application**: Execute the main class to start the game.

## Usage

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the application to start the game.
2. **Watch the Sequence**: Observe the sequence in which the LEDs blink.
3. **Replicate the Sequence**: Use the interface to replicate the sequence.
4. **Proceed to Next Round**: If the sequence is correct, proceed to the next round with an additional LED in the sequence.
5. **Repeat**: Continue playing to challenge your memory with increasingly longer sequences.
