# sequence_game_generator
This project is a Sequence Game Generator that uses LEDs to create a memory challenge game. Players must remember and replicate the sequence in which the LEDs blink. If the sequence is replicated correctly, the game proceeds to the next round with an additional LED in the sequence.
